## Description
This repo is for a global purpose, just pull it, install docker & docker-compose on your machine, and start building your application following the MVC standard without including any package

Here I didn't take care of the frontend(Views) because the purpose of <br>
this application is to build an API.<br>
You could build your frontend web/mobile application using your preferred stack.<br>

_Please feel free to contribute or suggest any missing stuff or security issue you see so that I can fix it._
